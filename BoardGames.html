            <p>The name and theme is a touchy subject, but the messsage of the game shows how deception was used for Hitler's rise to power. It is a social deduction
                game that initially doesn't sound fun, but after playing a game of it, shows how thrilling and addicting it is. The premise is that there are 2 teams, the Liberals and the 
                Fascists. They want to enact their respective policies by voting on the Chancelor and President. And if Hitler (a fascist) is ever successfully voted to be
                Chancelor after 3 fascist policies are encated, the fascists automatically win. The amount of betrayal and arguing the game creates
                is too fun to pass up.

            <p>I also love cooperation games, which is what Pandemic is about. All the players work together to cure 4 diseases by collecting 5
                cards of the respective disease to cure it. What is great about it is the strategy and its emphasis on mobility. Mobility might sound
                unecessary in this game, but a way to lose is to have too many outbreaks and diseases out at a time; so while you try to find a cure, you
                also have to maintain the diseased population. The only few things that I didn't love about this game is how often you'd lose from running out
                of cards in the draw deck, which is a lose condition. Often times, with bad luck, cards of a certain color could be piled up all at the end, which 
                would most of the time be too late to cure the remaining diseases.

            <h3>Coup</h3>
            <img src = "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0274/9631/products/Coup_1024x1024.jpg?v=1440219709">
            <p>Another deception game, but it's not necessary to lie. You are a government official trying to gain more power
                by demolishing your enemies' influenctial powers. You have 2 influence cards, basically your lives,
                and you want to kill everyone else's cards to win. If you lose both of your cards, you're out of the game. 
                Your cards have powers and counter-actions and are always hidden, so you can lie about what cards you have. If you lie however,
                and someone catches you, you lose a life. If someone falsely accuses you of lying, they lose a life. When you have 7 coins, you can 
                coup someone, basically make someone lose a character immediately. It is strategic and almost perfectly balanced with how the characters
                have balances and checks of each other. The only minor problem is getting eliminated and, in my opinion, the specific size
                that's best for the game. If you die first, you most likely will have to wait up to 30 minutes without any of the suspense.
                And the best amount of players to have is around 4-5 players. 6 players makes the game too long, and 2-3 players isn't as interesting or intense
                with more players.
