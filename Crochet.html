            <p class = "para">I had crocheted this little guy around in April 2024. It was one of my first stuffed animals.
                Initially, I didn't like it because of how I couldn't sew anything together without it looking botched.
                Now however, I like because of how much my grandma likes it. She loves my duckie because of its vibrant colors
                and "takes care" of it.

            <p class = "para">I made this around the summer time. I was using my sister's yarn, so when I ran out of the specific green for the head,
                I used a different but somewhat similar green yarn she had. This was a cute little mess, as the gauge was kept the same 
                for the body, even though the body yarn was finer than the head yarn. However, this didn't help it at all, as now the body almost looks like theres in it
                as the stitching is more space to the point where gaps are almost everywhere and the stuffing is poking out of it.

            <p class = "para">I made this little guy 3 times around fall to winter. I had originally made it for my friend,
                but I liked him so much that I made him for me and for another friend. It was also my first time using 
                felt, so aside from the wonky sewing, the glued felt on the face looks extremely derpy as well.
                It adds personality to it, I hope ðŸ¤­
